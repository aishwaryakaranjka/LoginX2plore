#Student Enrollment Form

•	Description
	This Student Enrollment Form integrates with JPDB (JSON Power Database) to manage student records efficiently. On loading, only the Roll No field is enabled.
	When a user enters a Roll No, the system checks if it exists in the database. 
	If new, it enables all fields for data entry and activates the Save button. If existing, it auto-fills the form, locks the Roll No, and enables the Update button.
	The Reset button clears the form. All required fields are validated before submission. Built with Bootstrap and jQuery, the form ensures a smooth user experience while connecting seamlessly with JPDB for database operations like inserting, updating, and fetching records. 
	Perfect for schools needing a simple yet effective student management system.


Benefits of using JsonPowerDB

	JsonPowerDB (JPDB) offers a fast, flexible, and developer-friendly NoSQL database solution. With high-speed performance (microsecond responses) and schema-less JSON storage, it simplifies data management without complex setups. 
	Its REST API integrates seamlessly with web/mobile apps, supporting real-time updates with serverless cloud hosting. 
	JPDB is cost-effective, secure (token-based auth), and scalable—ideal for prototypes, IoT apps, and dynamic projects. Unlike traditional databases, it requires zero configuration while delivering SQL-like querying in a NoSQL format. 
	Perfect for developers who need a lightweight, powerful database without the overhead!
